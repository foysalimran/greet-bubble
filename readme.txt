>😻 __for Feature Availability__

>This plugin is wonderful! It is possible to place different bubble videos within posts or pages. For example, on the HOME page I place bubble video 1. On the CONTACT page I place bubble video 2 and so on. We can also put up to 4 videos or links in the same bubble, which is fantastic. Bubble customization is also possible, which makes it easy to match the style of the site. The possibilities are endless and the best, without paying abusive monthly fees for it. The developer is very attentive and helpful. I loved the plugin and recommend it to anyone looking for a solution like this.
